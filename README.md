# Project Template
Basic skeleton for a project.

`exp1` can be updated with different names that are more specific (e.g., `adults` / `children`) 

`.gitignore` is set up to not push temp files or unnecessary files, including: 
- `background` folder: any background materials, such as literature review materials
- `materials` folder
- `RAW_DATA` folder: to prevent uploading identifiable data
